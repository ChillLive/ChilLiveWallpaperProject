  _Early access - v0.40_

</div>

**<div align="center">Illuminate your screen with light pastel colors and scenes that change slowly over the course of the day.**</div>

## A Chill live wallpaper?

_This little app is meant to make one travel to different lands, where the sky is always blue and countless stars twinkle in the night.
Every day, the Sun rises and sets at times based on your location, illuminating the scene in soft pastel colors. Through the year, the amount of snow and the color of the scene will change based on the season._

_This app is 100% ad free, and your data stays on your device.
You can use this app as a light/dark automatic mode. The battery consumption is optimized and you shouldn't notice any difference compared to a standard wallpaper._

  _Just relax, choose your wallpaper and start the journey!_
  
  [Dowload the app on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chilllive.chillwallpaperproject)

## Features

* Chill themes, displaying pastel colors that change slowly during the day
* The day and night cycle changes according to the user's location, with live sunrise/sunset - _if permission granted_
* Some of the scenes elements move or twinkle softly, such as the trees and stars
* Different scenes are available, with more to come in the future - _if I'm satisfied with the outcome_
* Easy one tap pseudo random scene shapes generation
* Parallax effect when scrolling the home screen
* Different "seasons" are available, changing the overall colors/scene and feel of the wallpaper

#### What do you sign for?

* No ads! This is a feel good app, so no ugly banners or annoying popup windows
* No locked/premium content at the moment - _only a tipping system for the generous souls :D_
* The app can use you coarse location to determine your local sunrise and sunset times
* Using this feature triggers a web request to [sunrise-sunset.org](https://sunrise-sunset.org)
* No personal data is stored/used in any way by this app, other than to provide sunrise/sunset times
* Low battery consumption - _never mentioned in any Android report. No significant impact on battery life noticed by the users_

## How to use

<img align="right" src="/Assets/showcaseGif.gif" width="200" height="450">

**1. Times and colors**
* Modify the app's behavior from here. Control the light of the scene by adjusting manually the time of the day, or just let it follows the real day&night cycle.
* Allows the app to access your location to set the sunset/sunrise time to match your real position
* Use a seed or generate a new pseudo random scene
* Advanced settings control the behavior of the scrolling effect

**2. Landscapes and seasons** 
* Change the season to access a new variety of colors
* Select the scene you like the most.

**3. Set this background as wallpaper** 
* Generate a live wallpaper preview based on the app current background

**4. Contribute** 
* App description, contribute to the project and rate the app from here

## What's next?
I have many ideas to implement, such as:
* More parallax settings
* Different landscapes and scenes
* More color varieties
* Details like the Moon, clouds
* Weather system - _in a far future_

## Disclaimer
This app is still in development. Therefore, you might encounter unexpected behaviors, bugs and performance issues.
As a non professional app developer and working on this project as a hobby on my free time, implementing some new features might take time, or maybe not happen at all.
Please keep this in mind when using this app.

## Known issues
* Scrolling can be slow, or even not happen on less powerful/older device. This is due to overdrawing scene layer/elements at high frame rate
* Scrolling is not enabled in landscape mode, and the scene is a little weird
* On certain devices, the first layer starts to delaminate on the right side of the scene
* The contrast between the text and the background can be sometimes low, making it hard to read the options

## Support the project
If you're considering to contribute to the project, THANK YOU!

Please, read the disclaimer section before continuing. When contributing, keep in mind that this app is _- for me -_ already in an advanced state,
and has almost all its main features already implemented. What will follow will be a bonus.

Any contributions are welcome. Here are a few ways you can help:

* Share the app around you
* Leave reviews and stars
* Report bugs and make suggestions
* Translate the app
* Make donations - either directly from the app (but Google will take its share, or by another future way to add here)

Note that as long as the app is in open testing, the tips won't work in the app. The feature is on test only and you won't be charged.

Thank you very much!
